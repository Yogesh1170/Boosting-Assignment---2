        "Gradient Boosting Regression, often referred to as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for regression, is a popular machine learning technique used for solving regression problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees to predict a continuous target variable. Gradient Boosting Regression is an extension of the gradient boosting framework, originally developed for classification tasks, adapted for regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an overview of how Gradient Boosting Regression works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - GBM starts with an initial prediction, often set to the mean of the target variable in the training dataset. This serves as the starting point for building the ensemble.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Process**:\n",
        "   - GBM performs an iterative process where it adds a new decision tree to the ensemble in each iteration.\n",
        "   - In each iteration, the algorithm focuses on the residuals, which are the differences between the actual target values and the current predictions. The new decision tree aims to capture the patterns in these residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Gradient Descent Optimization**:\n",
        "   - Gradient boosting involves gradient descent optimization to minimize the loss function. The loss function is specific to regression tasks and is often the mean squared error (MSE) or the mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Construction of Weak Learners**:\n",
        "   - In each iteration, GBM constructs a weak learner (decision tree) by fitting it to the negative gradient of the loss function, which guides the tree to predict the direction of the residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Weighted Combination**:\n",
        "   - The predictions from the newly constructed decision tree are combined with the existing predictions in the ensemble.\n",
        "   - The new predictions are added to the existing predictions, and each prediction is assigned a weight based on the learning rate (shrinkage) and the performance of the newly added tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Learning Rate**:\n",
        "   - GBM includes a learning rate (often denoted as \"η\") that scales the contribution of each new tree to the ensemble. A smaller learning rate results in slower convergence but can improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Termination**:\n",
        "   - The iterative process continues for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met. Common stopping criteria include reaching a specified number of trees or observing a lack of improvement on a validation dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Final Ensemble Model**:\n",
        "   - The final ensemble model is the sum of all the predictions from the individual trees, with each prediction weighted according to its importance in capturing the residual patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Prediction**:\n",
        "   - To make predictions on new data, Gradient Boosting Regression applies the entire ensemble model to the input features and produces a continuous prediction for the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Boosting Regression is known for its strong predictive power and robustness. It can effectively model complex non-linear relationships in the data. The algorithm is versatile and widely used in various regression tasks, such as predicting house prices, stock prices, and other continuous variables. Popular implementations of Gradient Boosting Regression include XGBoost, LightGBM, and scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor."

        "3. **Building Weak Learners**: During each iteration, a new weak learner (typically a decision tree with limited depth) is added to the ensemble.

In other words, it tries to predict the direction in which the current model's predictions need improvement.\n",
